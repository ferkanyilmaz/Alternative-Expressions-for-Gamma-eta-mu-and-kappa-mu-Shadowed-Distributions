Abstract
In this article, we propose alternative closed-form expressions in the form of weighted sum of exponential functions for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Gamma, η-µ and κ-µ distributions with integer fading parameters, and accordingly present how these proposed expressions can be easily applied to the performance analysis of wireless communication systems operating over (i) Nakagami-m fading channels, (ii) η-µ fading channels and (iii) κ-µ shadowed
fading channels.
